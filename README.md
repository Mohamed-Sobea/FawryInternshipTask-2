# Bookstore ‚Äì Internship Task

This project is a simple object-oriented bookstore system developed in Java.  
It was built as part of a Java internship challenge, and it demonstrates the use of core OOP principles, including:

- **Abstraction** (through the abstract base class `Book`)
- **Encapsulation** (private fields with public getters)
- **Inheritance** (book types like `PaperBook`, `EBook`, `DemoBook` extending the base class)
- **Polymorphism** (overriding behavior like `isForSale()` and `deliver()`)

The system simulates a bookstore where users can add, buy, and manage different types of books.
